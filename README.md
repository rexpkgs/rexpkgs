# rexpkgs

`rexpkgs` is an ecosystem split from `nixpkgs`, focused on minimalism, simplicity, and maintainability.

## Design Goals
1. **Minimal and unopinionated `stdenv`**: The `rexpkgs` `stdenv` is designed to be as minimal and unopinionated as possible, providing only the bare minimum needed to build packages. This is in contrast to `nixpkgs`, which has a very large and complex `stdenv`.
